# Python YAML Use Case

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Python application that utilizes information from a YAML file. The application reads student information from a YAML file and provides options to display and filter the data based on GPA. The YAML file contains student details like names, ages, majors, and GPAs.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the required package installed.

### Install PyYAML

To handle YAML files in Python, you will need the PyYAML library. If you don't have it installed, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

## Files

1. **app.py** - Python application to read and filter student data.
2. **students.yaml** - YAML file containing student data.

└── Python_Yaml_Use_Case.md  # Documentation file
```

## YAML File Structure

The **students.yaml** file contains information about students. Here's the format used:

```yaml
students:
  - name: Alice
    age: 21
    major: Computer Science
    gpa: 3.8
  - name: Bob
    age: 22
    major: Mathematics
    gpa: 3.5
  - name: Charlie
    age: 20
    major: Physics
    gpa: 3.9
  - name: David
    age: 23
    major: Chemistry
    gpa: 3.2
  - name: Eva
    age: 21
    major: Computer Science
    gpa: 3.7
```

### Explanation of the YAML Structure:
- **students**: A list of student dictionaries.
- Each student dictionary contains:
  - **name**: The student's name.
  - **age**: The student's age.
  - **major**: The student's major.
  - **gpa**: The student's GPA.

## Python Application

The **app.py** script performs the following tasks:
- Loads data from the **students.yaml** file.
- Displays information about all students.
- Filters and displays students with a GPA higher than a user-specified minimum.

### Code Overview

1. **load_data**: Loads data from the YAML file.
2. **display_students**: Displays information about all students.
3. **filter_students_by_gpa**: Filters students based on a minimum GPA.
4. **main**: Orchestrates loading data, displaying students, and prompting the user for input.

### Sample Code Snippet

```python
import yaml

def load_data(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        data = yaml.safe_load(file)
    return data

def display_students(students):
    print("\nAll Students:")
    for student in students:
        print(f"Name: {student['name']}, Age: {student['age']}, Major: {student['major']}, GPA: {student['gpa']}")

def filter_students_by_gpa(students, min_gpa):
    filtered_students = [s for s in students if s['gpa'] >= min_gpa]
    print(f"\nStudents with GPA >= {min_gpa}:")
    if filtered_students:
        for student in filtered_students:
            print(f"Name: {student['name']}, Age: {student['age']}, Major: {student['major']}, GPA: {student['gpa']}")
    else:
        print("No students found.")

def main():
    data = load_data('students.yaml')
    students = data['students']
    display_students(students)
    min_gpa = float(input("\nEnter minimum GPA to filter students: "))
    filter_students_by_gpa(students, min_gpa)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Running the Application

1. Ensure that **app.py** and **students.yaml** are in the same directory.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script:

```bash
python app.py
```

### Example Output

```
All Students:
Name: Alice, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.8
Name: Bob, Age: 22, Major: Mathematics, GPA: 3.5
Name: Charlie, Age: 20, Major: Physics, GPA: 3.9
Name: David, Age: 23, Major: Chemistry, GPA: 3.2
Name: Eva, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.7

Enter minimum GPA to filter students: 3.6

Students with GPA >= 3.6:
Name: Alice, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.8
Name: Charlie, Age: 20, Major: Physics, GPA: 3.9
Name: Eva, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.7
```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to read, display, and filter data from a YAML file in Python. The application can be further extended to include features like sorting, updating student data, or saving changes back to the YAML file.

## Next Steps
- Add sorting functionality to sort students by GPA or name.
- Allow the user to add, update, or delete students in the YAML file.
- Persist changes made by the user back into the YAML file.
